  <h3>Why i picked Full-Stack?</h3>
  <p>I picked full stack because of Tomas to be honest. He said the right buzzwords to wake up the
    more entrepeauner idea of tech pursuit. I plan to get a job where i can because , you know,
    , <b><em>Money</em></b>.
    The whole reason i came to Atlas was to explore an actual career in something. Because thats what <i>Adults</i>do
    when adulting</p>
